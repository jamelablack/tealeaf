1. What is the value of a after the below code is executed?
  a = 1
  b = a
  b = 3

My Answer: a = 1

2. What's the difference between an Array and a Hash?

My Answer:
An array is an object that stores a set of values in a specific order. 
	- used best when order matters
	- when a fifo/lifo structure is needed


A hash is a series of key, value pair sets ordered by order of insertion.
	- used best when the data has specific labels


3. Every Ruby expression returns a value. Say what value is returned in the below expressions:

		arr = [1, 2, 3, 3]
		[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq
		[1, 2, 3, 3].uniq!

My Answer: 
arr = [1,2,3]

4. What's the difference between the map and select methods for the Array class? Give an example of when you'd use one versus the other.

My Answer:
Map returns a value at a particular indicie and Select returns a particular value.

++++++++++SOLUTION:
Answer: Map and select are both methods that iterate through an array. Both are similar in that they return a new array. However, they are used for different situations.


Map is used to iterate through an array of elements, returning a new array with values of the called block. This block applies a method to each of the elements, thus transforming the existing array. Select is used to iterate through an array of elements, returning a new array with values that returns true for the block of condition. 

For example,

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The block is calling a method on each of the elements in the array.
arr.map { |e| e + 1 }       # => [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
arr.select { |e| e + 1 }    # => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The block is calling a condition on each of the elements in the array.
arr.select { |e| e.even? }  # => [2, 4]
arr.map { |e| e.even? }     # => [false, true, false, true, false]

5. Say you wanted to create a Hash. How would you do so if you wanted the hash keys to be String objects instead of symbols?

My Answer:
my_hash = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}

6. What is returned?


  x = 1

  x.odd? ? "no way!" : "yes, sir!"

  My Answer:
  "no way!"

  7.What is x?

  x = 1

  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

  My Answer = 4

  8. What is x?


  3.times do
    x += 1
  end

  puts x

  My answer: Error, undefined method.
