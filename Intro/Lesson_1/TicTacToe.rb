=begin

1. Come up with requirements/specifications - that will determine your own scope.
2. Application logic, sequence of steps.
3. Translation od those steps into code.
4. Run code to verfiy logic.=end


# Sequence of steps
=begin
1. Draw a board
2. Assign Player to "x"
3. Assign Computer to "o"
Loop until a winner or all squares are taken
4. Player 1 picks an empty square
Check for winner
5. Player 2 picks an empty square
6. Check for winner
7. If there is a winner, show winner; else "It's a tie"
