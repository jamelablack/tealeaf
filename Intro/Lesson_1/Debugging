How to debug?
 - Tips on how to work through bugs in your code or large problems where you don't know where to start.

1. Google - copy and paste error into Google. Someone has had your issue before. 
2. Write out pseudocode - write what you are attempting to do in code in plain engish
3. Break problems into small, numerical steps - start with what looks familiar ( or you know how to do)
4. Ask questions in the forum (Tealeaf)
5. Use binding.pry
6. Paste Errors or problems in Gist - take issue to IRC chat
7. Rubberduck debugging. 
When you come across a problem - explain how to came to that problem to your (fictitious) coworker - Ms. Rubberduck. Even better, explain the problem to someone who has no programming experience at all. 
8. Step away from the problem.
