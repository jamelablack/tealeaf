Types of CONDITIONALS
1. If/THEN
2. If on ONE LINE
3. Order of OPERATIONS
4. TERNARY OPERATIONS
5. CASE







#CONDITIONALS 1 (IF, THEN)
#def flow(x,y)
# 	if x > y
# 		 "x is better!"
# 	elsif x < y
# 		 "Y is better!"

# 	else 
# 		"You've got a tie!"
# 	end
# end

#  puts flow(3,3)

#CONDITIONALS 2 (IF, ONE LINE)
#puts "This is rad!" if x == 2

#CONDITIONALS 3 (UNLESS, ONE LINE)
#puts "This is not rad!" unless x == 5

#CONDITIONALS ORDER OF OPERATIONS
#1. <=, <, >, >=
#2. ==, !=
#3. && (Expression to the left and right must be true)
#4. || (Either expression to the left or right can be true)

#(4 == 4) || (5 <= 4)

#TERNARY OPERATOR
#x = 2? "Yes, this is true!" : "No, this is false!"

#CASE
#def run_that_case

# x = 3
# 	answer = case x
# 	when 3
# 		puts "Three times the charm!"
# 	when 4
# 		puts "You went to far!"
# 	else
# 		puts "Try harder!"
