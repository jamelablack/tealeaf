Bundle Install
Before you couldn't have multiple versions of gems installed on your machine when
switching b/w projects

Bundler creates a sandbox in your application where the proper versions of your gems
are stored

Bundle exec
does the samething and is used when your system level rake (rake db:migrate) for example
is not compatible with the current settings.
Therefore you have to use bundle exec rake db:migrate or just bundle exec.

Heroku uses Bundler

Creating your app:

Files you should always look at:
1. database.yml
Tells the application how to connect to the database
In development - we use sqlite3
In production - we use postgres (although in this course Heroku takes care it for us)


For sqlite - your database is in your code base and its one file, unlike others
where is an application and usually your database is hosted somewhere:
      production
        adapter: mysql
        database: myapp_development
        host: localhost
        username:
        password:


You will want to mimick your local enviornment as much as possible to your production
enviornment in order to catch bugs

2. Gemfile


3. Routes File
How the request initally get's routed. The blueprint of your application ad its
capabilities.

Folder Directory
app- where you spend most time
  assets - where you put all static files, images, etc.
  controllers
  mailers - outbound mail. Not good to use because you can easily get flagged as spam
   (use a transactional email provider (stmp mailers) hosts such as mailgun, postmark, etc. )
   models
   views - where our erb goes
bin - where your executable code goes - we never touch this
application.rb - sets application defaults such as timezone, load path
enviornment folder - configurations for development and production, and testing.
                  - you can also create custom enviornments - such QA, intergration or staging
initializers folder - where you files that you want to load when your application
                    is initialized
Config folder
  locales - yml files - is a way to internationalize your app. Is comprised of comlicated hashes
        and you no longer write using strings. Extremely painful to manage files
Lib - you can also put assets in there
Tasks - you can place rake tasks in here
log - stores all terminal logs from your application
public - where you store your error pages
      - robosts - tell search engines where to go within your application
Vendor - a relic from the past
.gitignore - tells git what files to ignore when committing. (.files are hidden files)
Readme - is what is dispayed when you push your app to Github.


________

Rake Routes - shows all possible endpoints in your application
You can also view your routes in your browser by going to localhost:3000/rails/info/routes
in Rails 4 only or you can use the terminal: rake routes | grep _______

Walking thru a Rails App

def index

  @posts = Post.all #anytime a capital letter (class method) is used, ActiveRecord is being called.

end

====================================================
Part 2 of Lecture

Relational Databases:
A series of Spreadsheets
To connect these tables in order to link infromation:
primary_key in rails is the "id"
foreign_key is the creation of a "user_id" column with the primary_key in on
other tables to connect to the main table.

2. There are 2 Views
  1. Data View: very much like Excel
  2. Schema View: lists the column name and the data type allowed for that column.

1:M
the Foreign_key is always on the many side of a one to many relationship

ORMs
ActiveRecord is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper), a pattern created by Martin Fowler
which describes how to abstract data from a database into code. Prior to this, using
PHP, you would write sql code directly in the views.

In console, using "= _" is equivalent to your last returned item.

Rails is good for simple, applications with quick builds that aren't for existing
application is analytics.
___
Setting up 1:M b/w posts and users
Posts were previously created

1. Create user table
Terminal: rails g migration create_users

2. Create Users model
Create model - singular, snack_case of Class name

3. Need to add foreign key to the many side (the Posts table)
Terminal: rails g migration add_user_id_to_posts

  Inside migration file:
  def change
    add_column :table_name :foreign_key (which is normally the resource+primary_key), :datatype (always will be integer)

    add_column :posts, :user_id, :integer
  end


4. Write in has_many and belongs_to on the models



Virtual Attribute - attributes that are not columns, are given through associations


Mass Assignment
The ability create/update AR obj through a hash where the keys match the attirbute
or virtual attribute.
example:
Post.new(title: "some title", url: "some url", user = User.first)

Post.new /Post.create will mass assign. Post.new is in memory (no user id assigned)
while Post.create will update to the database immediately.

Post.build and Post.new are the same.

When in the console:
You can run the following commands:
  user = User.first
  post = Post.first
  post.user **** virtual attribute
  post.title
  post.user_id = user ***NO, you can only set objects to object and integers to integers
  post.user_id = user_id
