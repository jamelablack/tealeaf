HTTP has two parts:


1. Request:
- Verb/Method: GET, POST
- URL
- Parameters

2. Response:
- Status Code
  - 200 Ok
  - 302 Redirect (issues another request)
  - 404 File Not Found
  - 500 Application Error
- Payload/Message/Body
  which will depend on the request

Modern browsers will block against redirect loops and/or limit redirects.

A request is not connected to another request - meaning its stateless.

An example:
GET/new_game
  - display the form to enter your name
  - render a view: 200 and HTML (complete the response)

POST/new_game
  - save the name somewhere (persistence layer)
  - display the next thing
  - redirect to another URL: 302 and the next URL completes the response.

Persistency Layer
1. Database (most common)
2. Session cookies (persistency within your browser)


Sinatra App
main.rb
set :sessions, true
get '/' do
  erb :welcome
end


post '/welcome' do

end
