To change video rating from the queue_item index,
we have to create the virtual attribute on the queue_item model, as though it is a column on the
queue_item model (table). Since it is not, in the model, we have to define the getter and setter.

def rating


end

def rating=(new_rating)
 -this is where you begin to write your tests
end


**update_attributes will go through validation error unlike the update_column method,
which will bypass validation.

  def rating=(new_rating)
    review = Review.where(user_id: user.id, video_id: video.id).first
    review.update_column(:rating, new_rating)
  end

** Memoization means the first time the record is called, it will hit the database only once and store that info
into the instance variable and will not database again when record is called.

    def review
      @review ||= Review.where(user_id: user.id, video_id: video.id).first
    end
