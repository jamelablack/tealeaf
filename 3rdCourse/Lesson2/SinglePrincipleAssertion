Single Assertion principle states:
A test suite should only have one assertion, so that if there is a failure
they fail separately. If you find yourself using "and" then you are probably
testing too much at once:
  get :index
  assigns(:todos).should == (cook, sleep)

There is an exception to this rule - when the assertions are very related concerning
  the same object:
  get :new
  assigns(:todo).should be_new_record
  assigns(:todo).should be instance_of(Todo)
