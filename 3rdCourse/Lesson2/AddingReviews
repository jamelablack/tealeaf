1. Add review section from UI controller to the video page
2. Hardcode some of the code as though the model were created
3. Add review test to video model - "sets reviews for authenticated users"
4. Add context to model various paths of expected behavior
5. Add before filters to dry up code


Possible Contexts:
1. Authenticated User submits a review
2. Authenticated User doesn;t complete required fields for review (validation error)
3. Unautheticated user attempts to submit a review

There are a couple differences between build and create,
but they're not big:

.create is equivalent to .new followed by .save. It's just more succinct.
.create! is equivalent to .new followed by .save! (throws an error if saving fails). It's also just a wee bit shorter
I think .build is mostly an alias for .new. It works one way in Rails 3 and another way in Rails < 3.x
The most important part, however, is that these methods can be called through an association (has_many, etc.) to automatically link the two models.
