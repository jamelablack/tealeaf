Better to focus on Queue Items rather
than just the collective view of the queue.

Before starting TDD, you should set up the view, controller, and routes.

Once routes are created, you then copy the views ui and update it
as though the methods for the models have already been created.

Then test methods you wrote in the views

using delegate will allow you refer to another model everytime a certain model is called

so therefore:

def category
  video.category
end

can be replaced with

delegate :category, to: :video
