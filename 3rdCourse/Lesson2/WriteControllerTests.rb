With any test, there are typically 3 actions:
1. Set up the data required for the action
2. Perform the action
3. Verify the the expected result

Controller Tests
- are typically considered more functional bc you're pulling together
multiple components

You typically never have to tests the render or redirect views portion of an action
because that is testing the functionality of rails rather than the code we write. The goal
of testing is to test the code we write only.

You do, however want to test redirect_to for unauthorized users.

Also if you dont wan't to rerun all the tests in your suite and just run one in particular
you can specify "line:27" and it will run the test on that line.   




class TodoController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @todos = Todo.new
  end

  def new
    @todo = Todo.new
  end

  def create
    @todo = Todo.new(params[:todo])
    if @todo.save
      redirect_to root_path
    else
    render :new
    end
  end
end

Steps:
1. Create directory: controllers
2. Create spec: todos_conroller.rb
3. Controller typically have two goals... render and redirect
