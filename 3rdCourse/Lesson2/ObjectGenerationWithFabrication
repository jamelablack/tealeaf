It's typical to create many objects during testing and the more attributes you have
the more cumbersome it could be to maintain, moreover, if an attribute changes, it then becomes very difficult
to update all those tests.
To make this better, we can use an object generator framework called Fabrication
Fabrication - is used for

Steps:
1. Create a folder under specs called "Fabricators"
2. create fabricator_todo.rb
  Fabricator(:todo) do
    name { "cooking" }
  end

3. You can also create a user each time a todo is created:
  Fabricator(:todo) do
    name { "cooking" }
    user { Fabricate(:user) }
  end

  or

  Fabricator(:todo) do
    name { "cooking" }
    user
  end
_____ In your test suite:
**If you want to create an object in your database
describe "#display_text" do
  let(:todo) { fabricate(:todo) }
  subject { todo.display_text }


**If you would rather create an object in memory, you could:
describe "#display_text" do
  let(:todo) { fabricate.build(:todo) }
  subject { todo.display_text }
