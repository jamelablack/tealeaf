A typically response to testing is "I don't have time, I have to meet my deadline"
As your project size increases, you technical debt increases to the nth degree as time passes.
The problem is that devs don't remember the code the wrote 3 months ago, so they have to do a "context switch"
and recall why they wrote the code they did. This often times can have a cascading effect of issues.

Rescue Projects:
That is why projects in this case are called rescue projects, bc they have to call in outside help to
fix their project. One of the first steps an outside company does to save rescue projects is create a test suite.
This is the pay off for the technical debt.
