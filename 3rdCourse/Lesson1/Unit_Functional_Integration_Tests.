There are 3 types of tests:
1. Unit
2. Functional
3. Integration


Coverage: Unit > Functional > Integration
Speed: Unit > Functional > Integration
Realistic: Integration > Functional > Unit

1) Unit Tests
- testing a component in isolation, focusing on 1 thing and making sure all cases are covered
- isolated components tested: routes, models, views, helpers
- allow you to thoroughly test all components.. as it is the closest to the code.
- is the fastest and gives you the best coverage



2) Functional Tests
- testing components in collaboration, making sure not only they work but that they play nicely with each other
- components tested: controllers (where everything interacts), typically once request/response cycle



3) Integration Tests - Builds upon functional tests in the sense that not only must play nicely together but they must
achieve a desired business objective.
- components tested: Goal is to emulate the user, typically occurs in browser and follows the entire business process and
that the business objective is achieved

There are multiple styles of testing.. it has become very much like an "art" as devs often times
develop a taste of styles for what to test, when, etc. In this course, we will primarily write unit and functional tests
leaving integration tests for important business workflows.
