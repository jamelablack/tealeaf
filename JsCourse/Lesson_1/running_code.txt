To run your code in your web browser, you can include it in your HTML file and run in Chrome, This can be done two ways:

1. Start out with basic HTML and then right before the closing </body> tag, include a script element. Within those tags, javascript can be written directly and executed when the page loads.

Exaple:
<body>
  <script>
    console.log("I'm run automatically!");
  </script>
</body>

2. Create an external javascript page and include it with the script element using the src attribute:

Example:
<body>
  <script src="my_javascript.js"></script>
</body>

You must refresh the borwser in both instances.
